Chef-server demo
================

Howto
----

1. copy a valid open source chef omnibus installer .deb into pkg

2. export environment variable OSC_INSTALLER and set it to point at the omnibus installer .deb, like so:

> export OSC_INSTALLER=pkg/chef-server_0.10.8-194-g3f47a07-1.ubuntu.10.04_amd64.deb

3. If you want, check it has been set correctly:

> echo $OSC_INSTALLER

4. run:

> vagrant up

Once the vagrant run is finished, the vagrant box will be setup with open source chef server running on it.

If there are any errors, they should be visible in the output from the vagrant up command.

If all was successful, you will have a set up knife.rb for the vagrant user and can run knife against the server.
